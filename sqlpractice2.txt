First of all we create a table with some data that was already provided about countries in the us
Then we copied from a csv to our pgadmin4 the data, that was cool
With the imported data we did some queries and practice to get some specific data abou the countries
Then we import another csv about supervisor salaries
With this one we started to play with it, for example we did a temporal table and copy the data there
We did more examples, like exporting an entire table with COPY, exporting only delected columns and exporting query results
